## Homeownership Rates by Racial Category

Here's a report about homeownership trends over time for different racial groups.

Each collaborator should make a different change -- make a line plot, add color, or hide the code.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
home_owner <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/home_owner.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Load library
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

# Make a line plot of the percentage of homeowners for racial categories over time


library(tidyverse)

# Make a line plot of the percentage of homeowners for racial categories over time

ggplot(data = home_owner) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = home_owner_pct, color = race))

# and color the plot by racial category

# Your code here
```
